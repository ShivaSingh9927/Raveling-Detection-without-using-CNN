# Raveling-Detection-without-using-CNN
Binary classification of images done without using CNN. 

Image classification problem using shallow supervised machine learning 
algorithms (apply only logistic regression (LR) and/or artificial neural networks (ANN)). The 
dataset consists of images obtained from pavements. The images can contain either raveling distress or 
no raveling distress. Your objective in this challenge is to develop a binary image classification model 
that can classify from a given image if it contains raveling distress or not. Your model performance is 
expected to depend on the chosen model (LR/ANN), model architecture (for ANN) and the features 
extracted from the images. To learn more about selection of features, refer to the following paper:
